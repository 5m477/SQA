# Chapter 13. Defect Prevention & Process Improvement

-	 Defect prevention approaches
-	 Error blocking
-	 Error source removal
-	 Process improvement

# QA Alternatives

-	 Defect and QA

	-	Defect error/fault/failure
	-	Defect prevention/removal/containment
	-	Map to major QA activities

-	Defect prevention (this chapter)

	-	Error source removal & error blocking

-	 Defect removal Inspection/testing/etc.

-	 Defect containment Fault tolerance and failure containment (safety assurance)

	-	Generic Ways for Defect Prevention

-	 Error blocking

	-	Error missing/incorrect actions
	-	Direct intervention
	-	Error blocked
	
		=>    fault injections prevented
		(or errors tolerated)

	-	Rely on technology/tools/etc.

-	 Error source removal

	-	Root cause analysis

		=>	identify error sources

	-	Removal through education/training/etc.

# Defect Prevention Why and How?

-	 Major factors in favor of defect prevention

	-	Super-linear defect cost increase over time

		-	early faults chain-effect/propagation
		-	difficulty to fix remote (early) faults
		-	in-field problems cost" significantly

	-	Other QA techniques for later phases
		-	even inspection after defect injection

-	 Basis for defect prevention: Causal and risk analysis

	-	Analyze pervasive defects
	-	Cause identification and fixing
	-	Risk analysis to focus/zoom-in

# Defect Cause and Actions

-	 Types of causal analyses

	-	Logical (root cause) analysis by expert for individual defects and defect groups
	-	Statistical (risk) analysis for large data sets with multiple attributes

		-	Model predictor variables ) defects
		-	\# defects often as response variable

	-	Cause(s) identified via either variation

-	 Actions for identified causes

	-	Remedial actions for current product
	-	Preventive actions for future products

		-	negate causes or pre-conditions

# Common Causes/Preventive Actions

-	 Education/training to correct human misconceptions as error sources

	-	Product/domain knowledge
	-	Development methodology
	-	Development process, etc.
	-	Act to remove error sources
	-	Cause identification: mostly through root case analysis

-	 Formal methods, Chapter 15

	-	Formal specification to eliminate imprecision in design/implementation
	
		(error source removal)

	-	Formally verify fault absence

# Common Causes/Preventive Actions

-	 Technologies/tools/standards/etc.

	-	Based on empirical evidence
	-	Proper selection and consistent usage or enforcement
	-	More error blocking than error source removal
	-	Cause identification: mostly statistical

-	 Process improvement

	-	Integration of many factors in processes
	-	Based on empirical evidence or logic
	-	Define/select/enforce
	-	Helping both error blocking and error source removal
	-	Cause identification: often implicit

# Education and Training

-	 People most important factor to quality

	-	e.g., vs. implicit languages (Prechelt, 2000)

-	 Development methodology knowledge

	-	Solid CS and SE education
	-	Methodology/process/tools/etc.

-	 Product/domain knowledge

	-	Industry/segment specific knowledge
	-	Type of products new vs. legacy etc.

		-	legacy product inter-operability

	-	General product environment, etc.

-	 Means of delivery formal and informal education + on-the-job training

# Other Techniques

-	 Appropriate software technologies

	-	Formal methods Chapter 15
	-	Cleanroom formal verification + statistical testing
	-	Other technologies: CBSE, COTS, etc.

-	 Appropriate standards/guidelines

	-	Mis-understanding/mis-communication decrease
	-	Empirical evidence for effectiveness
	-	Appropriate scope and formality

-	 Effective methodologies

	-	As package technologies/std/tools/etc.
	-	Empirical evidence
	-	Match to the specific product domain

# Tools for Error Blocking

-	 Programming language/environment tools

	-	Syntax-directed editor to match pairs
	-	Syntax checker/enforcer.
	-	General tools for coding standards, etc.

-	 Other tools

	-	Design/code and version control

		-	examples CMVC, CVS, etc.

	-	Tools for individual development activities

		-	testing tools, see Chapter 7
		-	requirement solicitation tools
		-	design automation tools, etc.

-	 General tools or tool suites for certain methodologies, e.g., Rational Rose.

# Process Improvement

-	 Integration of individual pieces for defect prevention => process improvement

-	 Selecting appropriate development processes

	-	Process characteristics and capability
	-	Match to specific product environment
	-	Consideration of culture/experience/etc.

-	 Process definition and customization

	-	Adapt to specific project environment
	-	e.g., IBMâ€™s PPA from Waterfall

-	 Process enforcement and ISO/9000

	-	"say what you do"
	-	"do what you say"
	-	"show me"

# Process Maturity for Improvement

-	 SEI/CMM Focus on defect prevention

	-	maturity level focus/key practice area

		1. ad-hoc competent people/heroics
		2. repeatable project management process
		3. defined engineering-process/orgnizational support
		4. managed prod./process quality
		5. optimized continuous process improvement

	-	expectation maturity" => quality improvement
	-	recently CMMI/P-CMM/SA-CMM/etc.

-	 Other process maturity work

	-	SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination)
		-	international effort
		-	assessment, trial, and tech. transfer
	-	BOOTSTRAP 2 ESPRIT programme

# TAME Process/Quality Improvement

-	 QIP: Quality Improvement Paradigm

	-	understand baseline
	-	intro. process change and assess impact
	-	package above for infusion

-	 GQM: goals/questions/metrics paradigm

	-	goal-driven activities
	-	questions related to goals
	-	metrics to answer questions

-	 EF: experience factory

	-	separation of concerns
	-	EF separate from product organization
	-	form a feedback/improvement loop

# Summary

-	 Key advantages

	-	Significant savings if applicable

		-	avoid downstream problems

	-	Direct affect important people factor
	-	Promising tools, methodologies, etc.
	-	Process improvement: long-lasting and wide-impact

-	 Key limitations

	-	Known causes of pervasive problems
	-	Difficulties analyzing complex problems
	-	Difficulties with changing environment
	-	Hard to automate
	-	Process quality <> product quality

-	 Comparison to other QA Chapter 17.
