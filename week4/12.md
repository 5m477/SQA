# Testing Sub-Phases

-       Original sub-phases in V-model:

        -       Operational use (not testing, strictly).
        -       System test for product speci(cid:12)cation.

# Integration Testing

-       Key characteristics:

        -       Object: interface and interaction among multiple components or subsystems.
        -       Component as a black-box (assumed).
        -       System as a white-box (focus).

		=> test interaction with environment.

# Acceptance Testing

-       Key characteristics:

        -       Object: whole system.

                -       but defect fixing no longer allowed.

# Specialized Testing

-       Specialized testing tasks:

        -       Some do not fit into specific sub-phases.
        -       Di(cid:11)erent goals (other than reliability).
        -       Non-standard application environment.

-       Our coverage:

        -       Defect diagnosis testing.
        -       Defect-based testing.
        -       Regression testing.
        -       Testing beyond programs.
        -       Testing for other goals/objectives.

# Defect Diagnosis Testing

-       Context of defect diagnosis testing:

        -       In followup to discovered problems by customers or during testing.
        -       Pre-test: understand/recreate problems.
        -       Test result: faults located.
        -       Followup with fault removal and re-run/re-test to confirm defect fixing.

-       Defect diagnosis testing:

        -       Typically involve multiple related runs.
        -       Problem recreation as the starting point.
        -       Perturbation and observation.
        -       Domain knowledge important.
        -       More recorded defect information

		=> less reliance on defect diagnosis.

        -       Defect-based techniques (below) useful.

# Defect-Based Testing

-       General idea and generic techniques:

        -       Focus: discovered or potential defects

		(and related areas).

        -       Ad hoc testing based on defect guesses.
        -       Risk identification ) risk-based testing.

		(Part IV, esp. Chapter 21)

        -       Defect injection and mutation testing.

-       Defect injection and testing:

        -       Inject known defect (seed known fault).
        -       Test for both seeded and ingenuous faults.
        -       Missed faults ) testing technique".
        -       Also used in reliability modeling.

-       Mutation testing ~ defect injection testing, but systematic mutants used.

# Regression Testing

-       Context of regression testing:

        -       In software maintenance and support:

                -       ensure change 6) negative impact.

        -       In legacy software systems:

                -       ensure quality of remaining functions,
                -       during development/product update,
                -       new part ~ new development,
                -       focus: integration sub-phase & after.
        -       Re-test to verify defect fixing as well as no unintended consequences.

-       Regression testing techniques:

        -       Specialized analysis of change: ^-analysis.
        -       Focused testing on (new) ^-part.
        -       Integration of old and new.

                -       test interactions with surroundings.

        -       Web testing, in case study later.

-       Testing to achieve other goals:

        -       Performance testing;
        -       Stress testing;
        -       Usability testing, etc.

-       Dynamic analysis and related techniques:

        -       Simulation to reduce overall cost.

# Test Integration

-       General idea:

        -       Many activities and tasks.
        -       Di(cid:11)erent techniques.
        -       Individual advantages and limitations.
        -       Much commonality exists.
        -       Possibility of integration?

-       Test integration: Advantages

        -       combined strength ) benefit".
        -       common elements ) cost#.
        -       (cid:13)exibility".

# Hierarchical Web Testing

-       Case study from Chapter 10 continued:

        -       Web navigation modeled by FSMs.
        -       UBST using UMMs to overcome state explosion problem of FSMs.
        -       Guiding existing web testing.

		(they typically focus on a small unit/facet)

        -       Lack of structure for overall hits

		=> use of simplified OPs (Musa OPs)

-       Overall approach:

        -       Top-tier: (cid:13)at (Musa) OP.
        -       Middle-tier: UMMs.
        -       Bottom-tier: existing web testing.

# Existing Web Testing

-       Web functionality testing:

        -       Focus on the web components identified in Chapter 10.
        -       HTML syntax checking via various tools.
        -       Link checking.
        -       Form testing.
        -       Verification of end-to-end transactions.
        -       Java and other program testing.

-       Beyond web functionality testing:

        -       Load testing.

        -       Web crawling via robots.

-       UMMs for web testing (Chapter 10).

        -       Availability/usage of web logs.
        -       Some observations:

                -       skewed top hit pages and x-references
                -       the impact of structural hierarchy

# Hierarchical Web Testing

-       Overall approach:

        -       Top-tier: (cid:13)at (Musa) OP

                -       for simplicity and skewed distribution.

        -       Middle-tier: UMMs

                -       importance of highly used navigations.

        -       Bottom-tier: existing web testing

                -       no need to re-invent wheels

-       Implementation support:

        -       TAR (top access report) ) top-tier
        -       CPR (call-pair report) to form clusters

		=> middle tier UMMs

        -       UMM refinement => bottom-tier

                -       low-level Markov chains and
                -       traditional (WBT-)testing models
