# QA and Fault Tolerance

-	Fault tolerance as part of QA

	-	Duplication: over time or components
	-	High cost, high reliability
	-	Run-time/dynamic focus
	-	FT design and implementation
	-	Complementary to other QA activities

-	General idea

	-	Duplication/redundancy used
	-	redo ) recovery block (RB)
	-	parallel redundancy

		=> N version programming (NVP)

-	Key reference (Lyu, 1995b): M.R. Lyu, S/w Fault Tolerance, Wiley, 1995.

	![](../pics/16-3.png)


# Hazard Analysis: FTA

	-	Starts with top event/accident
	-	Decomposition of events or conditions
	-	Stop when further development not required or not possible (atomic)
	-	Focus on controllable events/elements

		- (vs. temporal composition in ETA)

	-	Hazard resolution (more later)
		- component replacement etc.
		- focused safety verification
